## Phase 1: Prototype
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Status:** Not started

**Activities:**
- Minimal TRM integration in Librarium
- Synthetic data generation (geometric domain only)
- Train tiny TRM variant (CPU-friendly, small dataset)
- Basic routing logic implementation

**Success Metrics:**
- TRM solves >60% of simple geometric tasks
- Latency <200ms on CPU
- Integration works end-to-end

**Deliverables:**
- Working prototype with 1 domain
- Evaluation report
- Lessons learned document

## Phase 2: GeoBench Pilot
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks  
**Status:** Not started

**Activities:**
- Expand domains (geometric, logical, constraint)
- Generate full GeoBench dataset (10k+ tasks)
- Train production TRM (requires GPU access)
- Implement Blind Audit integration
- Full evaluation suite

**Success Metrics:**
- TRM >80% accuracy on structured tasks
- Hybrid approach beats pure LLM and pure TRM
- Cost reduction >50% on structured workload
- OG, HDR metrics validated

**Deliverables:**
- GeoBench benchmark results
- Comparison: TRM vs LLM vs Hybrid
- Public report (if approved)

## Phase 3: Production Integration
**Duration:** 12-16 weeks  
**Status:** Not started

**Activities:**
- Production-grade TRM serving infrastructure
- Librarium full orchestration with TRM
- BYON module interface implementation
- Monitoring, alerting, logging
- Documentation and runbooks

**Success Metrics:**
- Latency <100ms p95
- Availability >99.5%
- Cost per task <$0.001
- Zero critical incidents in first month

**Deliverables:**
- Production-ready TRM in Symbion ecosystem
- Operational documentation
- Performance benchmarks

## Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)
**Status:** Continuous

**Activities:**
- Continuous evaluation on production tasks
- Domain expansion based on needs
- Model retraining with new data
- Performance tuning
- New use case exploration

**Success Metrics:**
- Sustained accuracy improvement
- Cost efficiency maintained
- User satisfaction high

## Dependencies

| Phase | GPU Access | Dataset | Team |
|-------|------------|---------|------|
| Phase 1 | Optional (CPU ok) | Synthetic (1k) | 1-2 people |
| Phase 2 | Required (4x H100) | Full (10k+) | 2-3 people |
| Phase 3 | Required (serving) | Production | 3-4 people |
| Phase 4 | As needed | Continuous | 2 people |

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

**After Phase 1:**
- Prototype demonstrates >60% accuracy?
- Integration technically feasible?
- Team capacity available for Phase 2?

**After Phase 2:**
- GeoBench results competitive with LLM?
- Cost savings validated (>50%)?
- Blind Audit integration effective?

**Before Phase 3:**
- Business case positive (ROI >5x)?
- Infrastructure ready (GPU serving)?
- Operational team trained?

## Alternative Paths

**If no GPU access:**
- Use pre-trained TRM from Samsung (if available)
- Fine-tune smaller variant on CPU (slower)
- Defer to conceptual integration only

**If GeoBench results poor:**
- Focus on specific high-value domain
- Increase training data quality
- Consider hybrid-only approach (no pure TRM routing)

**If resource constraints:**
- Pause at Phase 1 (prototype only)
- Document findings for future
- Revisit when resources available
